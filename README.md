# Final Year Project with Diabetic Retinopathy Fine Grained Classification using Machine Learning

This is the final year project for the final year of my studies in Multimedia University (MMU)

![Preview](preview.jpg)

## **Features**

- Interactive streamlit application to visualize result of the final year projects using streamlit
- Contains sample jupyter notebooks which shows the process of image preprocessing, model testing and result
  The TensorFlow version used is 2.10.1 requires 8.1 cuDNN and 11.2 CUDA to run properly
  The PyTorch version used is 2.0.1 requires CUDA 11.7

## **Getting Started**

```
